	abstract = {Data is a critical resource for Machine Learning (ML), yet working with data remains a key friction point. This paper introduces Croissant, a metadata format for datasets that simplifies how data is used by ML tools and frameworks. Croissant makes datasets more discoverable, portable and interoperable, thereby addressing significant challenges in ML data management and responsible AI. Croissant is already supported by several popular dataset repositories, spanning hundreds of thousands of datasets, ready to be loaded into the most popular ML frameworks.},

In this paper, we introduce OpenML, a place for machine learning researchers to share and organize data in fine detail, so that they can work more effectively, be more visible, and collaborate with others to tackle harder problems.

In this paper, we present an R package to interface with the OpenML platform and illustrate its usage in combination with the machine learning R package mlr. We show how the OpenML package allows R users to easily search, download and upload data sets and machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we also show how to upload results of experiments, share them with others and download results from other users. Beyond ensuring reproducibility of results, the OpenML platform automates much of the drudge work, speeds up research, facilitates collaboration and increases the users' visibility online.},

	abstract = {At BioHackathon 2024 in Fukushima, we explored enhancing machine learning dataset metadata management by developing a tool for converting the Croissant ML format(Akhtar et al., 2024) from MLCommons, implemented on Hugging Face(The AI Community Building the Future, n.d.) and expressed in JSON-LD, into RDF(Manola et al., 2004) using Turtle format. This allowed us to load the data into triple stores like Qlever and Apache Jena Fuseki, improving interoperability and querying capabilities. RDF’s graph-based structure and SPARQL querying enable advanced integration and analysis across heterogeneous datasets, addressing challenges like blank nodes, undefined ontologies, and non-resolvable URIs in the Croissant schema. Despite its alignment with ML workflows, Croissant’s limited connection to controlled vocabularies and lack of resolvable URLs highlight interoperability challenges compared to other metadata standards. Feedback emphasized the need for more detailed metadata specifications, meaningful annotations, and extensibility while recognizing Croissant’s potential for advancing metadata management in machine learning and bioinformatics. This approach underscores the value of standardizing and extending metadata frameworks and tools to facilitate dataset discovery, reproducibility, and integration across diverse domains.},

            Dockstore (https://dockstore.org/) is an open source platform for publishing, sharing, and finding bioinformatics tools and workflows. The platform has facilitated large-scale biomedical research collaborations by using cloud technologies to increase the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of computational resources, thereby promoting the reproducibility of complex bioinformatics analyses. Dockstore supports a variety of source repositories, analysis frameworks, and language technologies to provide a seamless publishing platform for authors to create a centralized catalogue of scientific software. The ready-to-use packaging of hundreds of tools and workflows, combined with the implementation of interoperability standards, enables users to launch analyses across multiple environments. Dockstore is widely used, more than twenty-five high-profile organizations share analysis collections through the platform in a variety of workflow languages, including the Broad Institute's GATK best practice and COVID-19 workflows (WDL), nf-core workflows (Nextflow), the Intergalactic Workflow Commission tools (Galaxy), and workflows from Seven Bridges (CWL) to highlight just a few. Here we describe the improvements made over the last four years, including the expansion of system integrations supporting authors, the addition of collaboration features and analysis platform integrations supporting users, and other enhancements that improve the overall scientific reproducibility of Dockstore content.},
